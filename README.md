The continue keyword can be used in any of the loop control structures. It causes the loop to immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop.

In a for loop, the continue keyword causes control to immediately jump to the update statement.

In a while loop or do/while loop, control immediately jumps to the Boolean expression.
